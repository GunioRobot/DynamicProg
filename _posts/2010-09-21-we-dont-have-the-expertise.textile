A few months back I was talking with another developer at a user group meeting and I was asking him if they were doing any type of unit testing. The asnwer was, no, we don't have the expertise.

I may have give him one of my looks, because he kept going on how difficult testing was and no having time, etc, etc.

It's <strike>tragic</strike> funny that we all use that excuse to avoid doing and/or learning something that chanllenge our comfort zone.
