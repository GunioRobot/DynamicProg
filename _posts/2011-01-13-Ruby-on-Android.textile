__This are the notes I took live during the session.__

Recommended book "Hello, Android":http://pragprog.com/titles/eband3/hello-android 


h3. Programming paradigm

Activities: code behind the layouts. 
Services: code that will run in the background (Music, etc.)
Broadcast receivers: receive messages from the system (SMS, WiFi connection)
Content Providers: servers up the data (db's, flat files, etc)


Forget Eclipse, go to the command line, use the tools that you have, and go to Eclipse after that, will make your life so much easier.

Once you have a virtual machine running use adb from the command to interact with it, you can install and uninstall packages, shell into the phone, etc.

Declarative layout (tons of xml). (Me: Very similar to XAML) You can build the UI programmatically if you want but the recommendation is to use the declarative form.

Download and look at the samples.
