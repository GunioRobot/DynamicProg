If you were wondering I just try the <a href="http://mlb.com" target="_blank" title="Major League Baseball">MLB streaming</a> in Google Chrome. Silverlight works and I even had video, but the frames don't update and there is an ugly scroll bar at the bottom of the video screen. The audio works fine with no problem, something I couldn't said about Silverlight and Firefox for this particular site.<br/>

If I keep moving the scrolling bar the video frames refresh but that is kind of silly, isn't it?
