I was going to write a post about this but my thoughts are exactly the same as <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/fredriknormen/archive/2008/12/01/controllers-in-the-mvc-pattern-is-not-a-replacement-for-business-logic-layer.aspx" target="_blank">Fredrik Normen’s.</a>

For example, one thing that creeps me out is seen think like this in the Controller.

{% highlight aspx-cs %}
	public ActionResult Index()
	{
		var repository = IocContainer.GetClassInstance<IRepository>();
		var members = repository.GetAll<Member>();
		ViewData["members"] = members;
		return View();
	}
{% endhighlight %} 
 
Or even worse:

{% highlight aspx-cs %}
	public ActionResult CreateMember()
	{
		var member = new Member();
		member.Hydrate(Request.Form);
		if (member.Email == null)
		{
			ViewData.ModelState.AddModelError("Email", "Email can't be empty");
		}
		//More code here
	}
{% endhighlight %}
 
I don’t think that the controller should ever touch the repository and of course it shouldn’t do any type of validation besides data entry from the view.
