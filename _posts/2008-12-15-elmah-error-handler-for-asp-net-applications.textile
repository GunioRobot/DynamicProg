  This looks very interesting. (from their site)
  <blockquote>   ELMAH (Error Logging Modules and Handlers) is an application-wide error logging facility that is completely pluggable. It can be dynamically added to a running <a href="http://www.asp.net/">ASP.NET</a> web application, or even all ASP.NET web applications on a machine, without any need for re-compilation or re-deployment. 
    Once ELMAH has been dropped into a running web application and configured appropriately, you get the following facilities without changing a single line of your code: 
    <ul>     <li>Logging of nearly all unhandled exceptions. </li>      <li>A web page to remotely view the entire log of recoded exceptions. </li>      <li>A web page to remotely view the full details of any one logged exception. </li>      <li>In many cases, you can review the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Screen_of_Death#ASP.NET">yellow screen of death</a> that ASP.NET generated for a given exception, even with <tt>customErrors</tt> mode turned off. </li>      <li>An e-mail notification of each error at the time it occurs. </li>      <li>An RSS feed of the last 15 errors from the log. </li>      <li>A number of backing storage implementations for the log, including in-memory, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sql/">Microsoft SQL Server</a> and several <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/elmah/files">contributed by the community</a>. </li>   </ul> </blockquote>  I havenâ€™t use it yet, but it really sounds like something that I see myself incorporating into my tool box. You can download it from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/elmah/" target="_blank">Google code</a>.
