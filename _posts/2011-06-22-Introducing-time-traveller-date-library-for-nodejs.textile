title: Introducing Time Traveller, date library for node.js (and javascript).
summary: Dates are a pain. So I started to put together time traveller to try to alleviate that paint while working on node.js.

Javascript has the Date object that exposes a series of methods to create new dates, modify them and get the different "parts" of a date. It's not bad but is certainly fairly limited.

I wanted to create a simpler, easier way to work with dates.

You can get time traveller using npm:

<code>
    npm install timeTraveller
