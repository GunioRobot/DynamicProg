title: Yahoo.ca doesn’t work on IE8 be default.
summary: This is what you see-       Notice that the compatibility button is not shown by default. Looking at the code behind I see this-   	
	&amp;lt;!-- No DOCTYPE for IE6--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en-CA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;

  Notice that the compatibility button is not shown by default. Looking at the code behind I see this:
  <pre>	
	&amp;lt;!-- No DOCTYPE for IE6--&amp;gt;&amp;lt;html lang=&amp;quot;en-CA&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
	&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;</pre>

What make’s me think that yahoo is misdetecting IE8?


In any case manually adding the site to the compatibility mode fix this.


You may think that both Yahoo and Microsoft will have look at one of the top 10 sites, don’t you?


Maybe this affect only the Canadian version of the site?


I’m surprised because this is the first site I found it doesn’t work. I was expecting some other sites to have problem but never Yahoo.
