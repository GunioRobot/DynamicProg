<br>In a <a title="previous" href="http://blog.dynamicprogrammer.com/2009/02/14/IntegrateVisualStudioWithTortoiseSVNForFree.aspx" id="hnmi">previous</a> article I mentioned how to integrate VS 2008 with Subversion for free using a few settings and a script. (go read the previous article to get all the code).<br>When I run the script in Windows 7 all the menu items were grey out. The problem was that the script use the variable %PROGRAMFILES%. For whatever reason in Windows 7 this doesn't work and you have to replace with the hard coded path C:Program files and them everything works.<br><br>I guess that you should be able to do the changes in the vb script file before running it.<br>
