  I’m sitting besides my 19th month old trying to write some code. Of course he is trying to help me. Let me tell you his C# is not bad :-) He was so exited about typing thaT I decided to give him something he could play with. I remembered <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/babysmash/index.htm" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman’s baby smash</a>. So I went to the site and install it. 
  I have to admit that this have been the easiest application ever to install (I had .net 3.5 installed already). Just click once, one prompt, and there you go.
  My son got hooked immediately. Tree house was in the TV but he just couldn’t stop banging the keyboard. I still can’t write any code, but at least one of us is happy. I better go to get my other machine.
