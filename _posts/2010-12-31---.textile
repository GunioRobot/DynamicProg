If you are starting on a green field project.

I recently had the luxury to start a few projects from scratch. The elusive green field projects. One thing I noticed is all the things that I need to have in place to be able to move forward at any considerable pace. I decided to put this post together as a reminder of that and why I considered them must have. 

_I'm not saying that your project will fail if you don't do exactly as I describe here. I'm just saying that these are the things I use and processes I follow today to be able to deliver._

A good IDE and/or a Text editor that helps you to be very productive. Install as many plugins as you need (but no more) to save time and make your coding/design experience as painless as posible. You will spend most of your time in here, so you better be comfortable with it.

The best VCS you can get your hands on. The good thing is, the really good ones are free! I'm partial to DVCS systems now, Git or Mercurial works really well. But if you are comfortable with Subversion go ahead. I recently switched back from Git to Subversion in one of my projects to avoid the learning curve of some of the team members, since the project was time sensitive.

A CI server thats easy to setup and maintain. At their core CI servers are just glorified schedullers, so setting one up should not take more than an hour.
