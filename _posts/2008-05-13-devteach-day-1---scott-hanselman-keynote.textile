Following to yesterday presentation at the TVBUG, Scott Hanselman gave the keynote on <a href="http://astoria.mslivelabs.com/">Data Services</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/default.aspx">Dynamic Data</a>.
Both of this two (products?, projects?, solutions?) are focus in different ways to provide access to your data.<br><br>Dynamic data allows you to very easy and quick create all the admin forms for a given database (similar but different to the scaffolding on Rails).<br>The main difference is that there is not code generated for the pages you see.<br>All the code is based on templates and every rendered field is based on templates as well, so you can very easily change the way a field will render.<br><br>Data services was already covered in my previous post about Scott's presentation at the TVBUG.<br>&amp;nbsp;
