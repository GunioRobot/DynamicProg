Ok, the patch can be downloaded from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bigvisiblecruise/issues/detail?id=32" target="_blank">Issue tracker of the project</a>. 

This support the following notation in the app.config.

{% highlight xml %}
<setting name="IncludedProjects" serializeAs="Xml">
	<value>
		<ArrayOfString xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
			<string>CCNet</string>
			<string>Ivy.NET</string>
		</ArrayOfString>
	</value>
</setting>
{% endhighlight %}

Where each <string> is the name of a project. The project names are case sensitive. If you set a RegEx to filter the projects, the expression will be evaluated first.

This patch have been done over the Revision 125 of the Trunk.

Enjoy!
