<p><strong>Octopress is a blogging framework designed for hackers</strong>, based on <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> the blog aware static site generator powering <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github pages</a>.
If you don't know what Jekyll is, <a href="http://metajack.im/2009/01/23/blogging-with-git-emacs-and-jekyll/">Jack Moffitt</a> wrote a good summary:</p>

<blockquote><p>Jekyll is a static blog generator; it transforms a directory of input files into another directory of files suitable for a blog. The management of the blog is handled by standard, familiar tools like creating and renaming files, the text editor of your choice, and version control.<br/>

<p>There's no database to set up, and you get to use tools like Emacs, vim, or TextMate to write your posts, not some lame in-browser text editor. Just write, generate, deploy, using the same tools and patters you already use for your daily work.</p>
