      <Content>&lt;p&gt;I really like the &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/ajaxhks/"&gt;Hacks &lt;/a&gt;series form &lt;a target="_blank" href="http://www.oreilly.com/"&gt;O'Reilly&lt;/a&gt;, these are very simple references books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They present a problem and a solution in the form of quick articles and they are usually based on common issues for that technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book in the series presents 80 different hacks or techniques to create AJAX driven web sites. From simple stuff like a basic cross browser XHR library to more complex stuff like mash-ups, use of Prototype, Rico and Direct Remoting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code examples are good but I found that some of them are not really ready to copy and paste into your application and you should look into them as starting points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example in some demos using Prototype the make use of both the $() function and the DOM equivalent document.getElementById(), I could like to see some consistency in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides that, the book is really good and you will find yourself flipping through its pages while putting together your next AJAX application.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
