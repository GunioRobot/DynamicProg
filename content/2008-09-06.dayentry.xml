      <Content>I just came across this series of posts, &lt;a href="http://eraserandcrowbar.com/ArchitectureByBaseball.aspx" title="Architecture by Baseball" target="_blank"&gt;Architecture by Baseball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;This series seems to be writting for me. I'm a baseball fanatic and I use techniques borrowed from baseball to manage my teams.If you are in a Team lead position or doing some architecture work as part of a team (specially if work in an Agile team) I suggest you read this serie.
&lt;br&gt;I also want to recommend the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Joe-Torres-Ground-Rules-Winners/dp/0786884789/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1220674868&amp;amp;sr=1-1" title="Joe Torre's Ground Rules for Winners: 12 Keys to Managing Team Players, Tough Bosses, Setbacks, and Success" target="_blank"&gt;Joe Torre's Ground Rules for Winners: 12 Keys to Managing Team Players, Tough Bosses, Setbacks, and Success&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; It doesn't matter if you are a Red Sox fan or you hate the Yankees, this is a good book about management in a very competitive and stressful position.Good readings!</Content>
