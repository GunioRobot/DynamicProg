      <Content>I see you have posts about using BigVisibleCruise and that in your latest one you have moved to getting TeamCity working.  My dev team recently moved from CCNet to TeamCity and we use Cradiator (http://cradiator.codeplex.com/), a fork of BigVisibleCruise with a load of enhancements, for or CI build status/radiator.

Because of this change, I wrote a plug in for TeamCity that allows Cradiator to do its job on TeamCity Builds.  It is now included in the Cradiator project.

Check it out if your looking at this type of thing.

Cheers!

James.</Content>
