      <Content>@Jeffrey:
You are more than welcome, glad I can help! I think that the MVC and the MvcContrib project are one of the most existing things going on right now.</Content>

      <Content>Hi Programmer, could you please share an example of implementing the class? Specifically I'd like to open and edit a css in a DataGridView. As a &amp;quot;former&amp;quot; journalist myself who still considers himself one, I'm trying to ceate an application for an even more technologically friend who wants to put his publication online in one of those flipbook styles; but I want to shield him from editing XML and CSS files. Yes, he's that challenged.

I've clumsily converted the css to xml and added it to a grid but would still need to reconvert and save as CSS.</Content>
