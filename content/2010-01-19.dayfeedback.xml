      <Content>Great writeup.  This was my first year at CodeMash too.  I really enjoyed it and I hope I can attend it again next year.  I will try to bring the family next time too.

My only complaint was the network was ungodly slow.  Other than that pretty much all the sessions were great.  A wide choice of topics and the hotel and food were great.

Joe O'Brien's Rafactoring the Programmer and Mary's Lean Keynote were very memorable and was what I needed coming back to work starting off the 2010 with positive motivation to improve my skillset and work environment.
