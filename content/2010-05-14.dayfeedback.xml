      <Content>Hey, thanks for posting this. I have a few questions regarding the capabilities of Kobo -

1) Can you annotate (specially highlight) all the types of files (in different file formats)?
2) Do you have to convert PDFs to ePub to make the text more readable? (I am asking this because I bought a Sony few days back but returned it, because of some limitations - like some of the PDF files' font used to be so small that I had to magnify it to read properly, but then the diagrams and other images got screwed)

Regards,
Manoj.</Content>

      <Content>1) Supports both ePub and PDF
2) PDF's are Ok but with limitations, diagrams and so don't get screwed but you need to scroll horizontally what's annoying. I converted a few PDF's to ePub but I'm not happy with that. SO I stick to ePub format. Most of the books I read usually have an ePub format available.</Content>
