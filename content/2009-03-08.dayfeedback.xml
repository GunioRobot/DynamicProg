      <Content>It is really the shame that in the year 2009 in february we get such an outdated book.
Mostly when NHibernate is changing so fast, v2.1 is comming with few neat changes, FluentNhibernate is here etc etc...

I would buy this book, just my opinnion, better watch _excellent_ summerofnhibernate.com videos.</Content>

You are right, it could be nice to have version 2.0 also covered in this book, but 
I disagree and this not been a useful book. I think that you have a lot of information even without covering V2.0 or FluentNHibernate. Most of the concepts very well apply. summerofnhibernate.com is a very good resource as well.</Content>
