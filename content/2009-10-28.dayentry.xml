      <Content>&lt;p&gt;The tag line of &lt;a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning" target="_blank"&gt;the book is refactor your wetware&lt;/a&gt;, and after reading it, you will.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_%28author%29" target="_blank"&gt;Andy Hunt&lt;/a&gt; explores how the brain works and try to point us (the readers) into ways to improve our use of it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For me the first five parts; Introduction, Journey from novice to expert, This is your brain, Get in your right mind and Debug your brain; is where I found the book most useful. This is not to say that the last four parts weren’t interesting, but for whatever the reason I took some effort on my part to concentrate and finish them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book had several a-ha moments. The Dreyfus model was specially interesting and the idea of carry around a pad to write any idea you may have has serve me well so far. (Note: My journalism teachers all insisted that we always carry a pad to take notes and make observations, but I never extended the practice as a developer.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you are into continuous improvement this is a book that you should read. I’m sure you will find some or all of it useful.&lt;/p&gt;</Content>
